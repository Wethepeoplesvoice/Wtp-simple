              Government has grown bigger, more complicated, and harder to follow. Most people are
              working, raising families, and trying to survive — they don’t have hours to dig through
              8,000-page bills, budgets, and legal language. That fog is where bad decisions, quiet
              deals, and unfair policies slip through.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every year the IRS and state governments collect huge sums from families, workers, and
              small businesses. States stack on income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, gas taxes,
              “fees,” and fines. We fund bloated agencies, useless positions, and contracts with no
              spending caps — while ordinary Americans live paycheck to paycheck.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time, billionaires, big donors, and media empires pour money into the system
              to control the story we hear. They keep us divided and distracted while the same insiders
              stay in office for decades and grow richer off our work.
            </p>
            <p>
              America’s Torch exists for people who are done being played. It’s for moms, dads,
              grandparents, and young people who still love this country, who still believe in peaceful
              change, and who know that if we stand together, no government, party, or network will ever
              blow out our flame.
            </p>
            <p>
              This platform is a simple promise: to shine light on what they’re doing, in language
              everyone can understand, and give millions of ordinary Americans an easy way to act{" "}
              <em>together</em> — instead of shouting alone at a screen.

              </p>
              <p>
                We, the undersigned citizens, are deeply concerned about the growing distance between
                government power and the people it is supposed to serve. We call for:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Real-time transparency for major federal spending, rate hikes, and new taxes that
                  impact households.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Full disclosure of large donations, financial conflicts, and foreign-linked income for
                  all members of Congress and senior officials, with easy, public tools for citizens to
                  see who is paying whom.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Stronger, faster oversight when officials abuse their office, break the public trust,
                  ignore the will of the people, or protect their friends instead of the law.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                These reforms are not about left or right — they are about restoring basic trust,
                honesty, and accountability in a government that is supposed to belong to the people.

              <p>
                Without real term limits, the American people will never fully trust the federal
                government again. Power will never return to ordinary citizens as long as the same
                insiders stay in office for life, fueled by big donors and billionaire money.

            Most Americans never file a formal complaint because the forms are buried, confusing, or

            alerts you care about.
